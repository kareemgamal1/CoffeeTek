        <h1>We Believe in the Pursuit of Doing Good</h1>
        <p>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s<br />
          historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Coffe Tek opened its<br />
          first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices<br />
          from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name <br />
          was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick”</p>
